# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

---First I did a select all statement to take a look at the data I will be working with

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata; 
 
--- Then I determined the different time signatures in the data

SELECT DISTINCT time_signature FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--- Then I determined which time signature were most songs written in 

SELECT time_signature, COUNT(id) AS songs FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY time_signature;
    
--- Then I determined which songs were written in 3 time signature, its popularity score, and the artist that sings it

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    WHERE time_signature = 3;
